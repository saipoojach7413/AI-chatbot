🤖 AI Chatbot for Customer Service

This project is an AI-based chatbot that helps customers and retailers communicate better through an online bargaining system.
It predicts discounts using Machine Learning and allows users to negotiate prices with the system just like in real life.

📝 About the Project

Most e-commerce websites don’t allow customers to bargain or talk directly with the seller.
This chatbot makes that possible!
It predicts the best discount based on:

Product ID

Customer ID

Quantity

and helps customers get the best price while also keeping it fair for the seller.
